Known bugs:
    - If the search includes the output file where the search
    results are stored, it will find entries in the file until
    you run out of hard drive space.
    - The help flag must be preceded by two arguments for searching

Future plans:
    - Transfer parsing of all args to parseArgs (rather than
    only flags). This should solve the help flag bug above.
    - Add case sensitive and case insensitive searches.
    Right now, all searches are case sensitive.
    - Maybe build the Makefile with autotools. It would make
    some maintenance a lot less work.
    - Add install targets to Makefile, so the program winds
    up executable from the system path
    - Add support for regular expressions

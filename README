FilePeruser User Guide
----------------------

1. Usage:
       ./FilePeruser [search string] -d [root directory] [flags]
   Valid flags:
       -h or --help: prints help and exits program
       -x or --exclude: next argument is a directory to exclude
       -d or --dir: next argument is the root directory of the search
       -s or --search: next argument is the search string
       -o or --output: next argument is the output file name
   Notes:
       all spaces in [search string], [root directory], and any excluded
           directories must be properly escaped to function properly
       -x and --exclude can be used as many times as necessary to exclude
           multiple directories from the search
       -d and --dir can be used as many times as necessary to add root
           directories to the search

2. Requirements:
       - A C compiler with dirent.h and sys/types.h (something at least partly POSIX-compliant)
       
       Note:
           I do not know any more of the system requirements for this program.
           If any more are discovered, add them here.

3. Philosophies:
       - Code should be robust, yet minimalistic.
       - A GUI is unnecessary for this little program.

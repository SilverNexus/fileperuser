FilePeruser User Guide
----------------------

1. Usage:
       fileperuser -s [search string] [flags]
   Valid flags:
       -h or --help: prints help and exits program
       -x or --exclude: next argument is a directory to exclude
       -X or --exclude-path: next argument is a path to exclude from the search.
       -d or --dir: next argument is the root directory of the search
       -s or --search: next argument is the search string
       -o or --output: next argument is the output file name
       -f or --log-file: next argument is the log file name.
       -l or --loglevel: next argument is an integer representing
                         minimum log level to be written to file.
       -p or --printlevel: next argument is an integer representing
                         minimum level of log message to be printed.
       -n or --no-case: perform search without case-sensitivity
   Notes:
       all spaces in [search string], [root directory], and any excluded
           directories must be properly escaped to function properly
       -x and --exclude can be used as many times as necessary to exclude
           multiple directories from the search
       -x and --exclude exclude every instance of that folder name, regardless of where
           in the search it is encountered
       -d and --dir can be used as many times as necessary to add root
           directories to the search, or none at all to search current directory
       -p, --printlevel, -l and --loglevel should be followed by an integer. The values
           are as follows:
               0: DEBUG
               1: INFO
               2: WARNING (default print and log level)
               3: ERROR
               4: FATAL
       -X and --exclude-path exclude a specific path from the search.
           This differs from -x, with excludes any instance of a folder name.
           -X is useful for excluding a folder with the same name as a folder
           elsewhere in the search tree, but one should be searched and not the other.
       -X and --exclude-path can also be used to exclude specific files from the search.

2. Requirements:
       - A C99 compiler with ftw.h (something at least partly POSIX-compliant)
         and with functions strstr, strcasestr, and nftw.
       Note:
           I do not know any more of the system requirements for this program.
           If any more are discovered, add them here.

3. Philosophies:
       - Code should be robust, yet minimalistic.
       - A GUI is unnecessary for this little program.

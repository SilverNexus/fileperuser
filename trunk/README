FilePeruser User Guide
----------------------

1. Usage:
       ./FilePeruser [search string] [root directory] [flags]
   Valid flags:
       -h or --help: prints help and exits program
       -x or --exclude: next argument is a directory to exclude
   Notes:
       all spaces in [search string], [root directory], and any excluded
           directories must be properly escaped to function properly
       -x and --exclude can be used as many times as necessary to exclude
           multiple directories from the search

2. Requirements:
       - A C compiler with dirent.h and sys/types.h (probably Linux or Unix [BSD, Mac])
       
       Note:
           I do not know any more of the system requirements for this program.
           If any more are discovered, add them here.

3. Philosophies:
       - Code should be robust, yet minimalistic.
       - A GUI is unnecessary for this little program.

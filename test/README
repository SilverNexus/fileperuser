This is where various unit tests and metrics are put in order to ensure that the program runs correctly.

All tests in here should be built independently of the main executable.
That is, nothing in the main executable should require parts of these tests.
For accuracy, however, these tests may call the main executable or compile specific
code files of the main program.

The performance test requires valgrind, since it uses the callgrind tool from it to
measure the performance of each search function.

The search test verifies that the current build of the program returns expected
results from the search.

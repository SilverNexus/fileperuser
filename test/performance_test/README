The performance test compares the performance of each of fileperuser's search methods
with the performance of several standard and nonstandard search operations.

The programs will expect that there is a file with a set of good variety test data,
a search string, and valgrind to evaluate the performance of each type.

The supplied Makefile will perform all the necessary builds.
If your computer is missing one of the tested nonstandard functions, such as
memmem(), then you may need to remove it from your Makefile and the subsquent test
from the test script.

After building the executables (`make` should suffice), run run_test.sh to run
the collection of tests.

There are four groups that should share result counts.
1. fp_memcasechr
2. fp_memcasemem_boyer strcasestr
3. fp_memmem_boyer fp_memmem_brute memmem strstr
4. strchr memchr

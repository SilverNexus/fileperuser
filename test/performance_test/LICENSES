UniversalCodeGrep and Crossfire RPG Game are both distributed under
the GNU Genreal Public License; version 3 and 2, respectively.

If we assume that the test file is a derivate work of both those projects,
this should fall under the license agreement of the GNU General Public License.

Should the maintainers of either project wish, I can remove parts of their program
from my test data. I have other text I can use for test data, and wouldn't mind
changing it if necessary.
